PREFACE
===============================================================================

:sc:`This` little book contains the Conversations
and Letters of one Nicholas Herman of
Lorraine, a lowly born and unlearned man;
who, after having been a soldier and a footman,
was admitted a lay-brother among the
Carmelites Déchaussés (bare-footed) at Paris
in 1666, where he served in the kitchen of
the community. He was afterwards known
by the name of Brother Lawrence. He died
in February 1691, at the advanced age of
eighty, after a life the true saintliness of
which can be well realised from these
collected Conversations and Letters.

The former, which are prefixed, are
supposed to have been written by M. Beaufort,
Grand Vicar to Cardinal de Noailles,
Archbishop of Paris, sometime Bishop of Chalons,
by whose recommendation they were published.

This translation of the Conversations and
Letters of Brother Lawrence has been compared
with the French of the original edition
of 1692, and such alterations have been made
as conduce to bring out more clearly the
meaning.

The dates have been given, wherever
practicable, and a strict chronological order
has been observed.

The additional matter consists of the
Seventh Letter, which has not been included
in former translations, and a rendering of
part of the preface to the original edition of
1692.

FROM THE PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION
===============================================================================

    .. class:: align-center

        1692

:sc:`Although` death has carried off last year
many of the Order of the Carmelites
Déchaussés, brethren who have left in dying
rare legacies of lives of virtue, Providence, it
would seem, has desired that the eyes of men
should be cast chiefly on Brother Lawrence,
and has made his death the occasion of
showing forth the merit of this holy man, who
all his life had studied to avoid the gaze of
men, and whose saintliness is only fully seen
now that he is dead.

Several persons having seen a copy of one
of his letters, have desired to see more; and
to meet this wish, care has been taken to
collect as many as possible of those which
Brother Lawrence wrote with his own hand.

These letters are so edifying, so rich in
unction, and have been found so full of delight
by those who have had the joy of reading
them, that the first readers have desired not
to be alone in profiting by them. It is at
their wish that the letters have been printed, for
they judge that these writings will prove very
useful to souls who are pressing forward to
perfection by the Practice of the Presence of
:sc:`God`.

All Christians will find herein much that is
edifying. Those in the thick of the great
world will learn from these letters how greatly
they deceive themselves, seeking for peace
and joy in the false glitter of the things that
are seen, yet temporal: those who are seeking
the Highest Good will gain from this book
strength to persevere in the practice of
virtue. All, whatever their life-work, will find
profit, for they will see herein a brother,
busied as they are in outward affairs, who in
the midst of the most exacting occupations,
has learnt so well to accord action with
contemplation, that for the space of more than
forty years he hardly ever turned from the
Presence of :sc:`God`.




CONVERSATIONS
===============================================================================




FIRST CONVERSATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        *August 3rd, 1666*

:sc:`The` first time I saw *Brother Lawrence* was
upon the third of August, 1666. He told me
that :sc:`God` had done him a singular favour, in
his conversion at the age of eighteen.

That in the winter, seeing a tree stripped
of its leaves, and considering that within a
little time, the leaves would be renewed, and
after that the flowers and fruit appear, he
received a high view of the Providence and
Power of :sc:`God`, which has never since been
effaced from his soul. That this view had
set him perfectly loose from the world, and
kindled in him such a love for :sc:`God`, that he
could not tell whether it had increased in
above forty years that he had lived since.

That he had been footman to M. Fieubert,
the treasurer, and that he was a great
awkward fellow, who broke everything.

That he had desired to be received into a
monastery, thinking that he would there be
made to smart for his awkwardness, and the
faults he should commit: but that :sc:`God` had
disappointed him, he having met with nothing
but satisfaction in that state.

That we should establish ourselves in a
sense of :sc:`God’s` Presence, by continually
conversing with Him. That it was a shameful
thing to quit His conversation to think of
trifles and fooleries.

That we should feed and nourish our souls
with high notions of :sc:`God`; which would yield
us great joy in being devoted to Him.

That we ought to *quicken, i.e., to enliven our
faith*. That it was lamentable that we had
so little; and that instead of taking *faith* for
the rule of their conduct, men amused themselves
with trivial devotions, which changed
daily. That the way of Faith was the spirit
of the Church, and that it was sufficient to
bring us to a high degree of perfection.

That we ought to give ourselves up entirely
to :sc:`God`, with regard both to things temporal
and spiritual, and seek our satisfaction only
in the fulfilling of His will, whether He lead
us by suffering or by consolation; for all
would be equal to a soul truly resigned. That
there was need of fidelity in those times of
dryness, or insensibility and irksomeness in
prayer, by which :sc:`God` tries our love to Him:
that *then* was the time for us to make good
and effectual acts of resignation, whereof one
alone would oftentimes very much promote
our spiritual advancement.

That as for the miseries and sins he heard
of daily in the world, he was so far from
wondering at them, that, on the contrary, he
was surprised there were not more,
considering the malice sinners were capable of:
that for his part, he prayed for them; but
knowing that :sc:`God` could remedy the mischiefs
they did, when He pleased, he gave himself
no farther trouble.

That to arrive at such resignation as :sc:`God`
requires, we should watch attentively over all
the passions which mingle as well in spiritual
things as those of a grosser nature; that :sc:`God`
would give light concerning those passions
to those who truly desire to serve Him.
That if this was my design, viz., sincerely to
serve :sc:`God`, I might come to him (B. Lawrence)
as often as I pleased, without any fear of
being troublesome; but, if not, that I ought
no more to visit him.




SECOND CONVERSATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        *September 28th, 1666*

That he had always been governed by love
without selfish views; and that having resolved
to make the love of :sc:`God` the *end* of all his
actions, he had found good reason to be well
satisfied with his method. That he was
pleased, when he could take up a straw from
the ground for the love of :sc:`God`, seeking Him
only, and nothing else, not even His
gifts.

That he had been long troubled in mind
from a sure belief that he was lost; that all
the men in the world could not have
persuaded him to the contrary; but that he had
thus reasoned with himself about it: *I did not
engage in a religious life but for the love of*
:sc:`God`, *and I have endeavoured to act only for
Him: whatever becomes of me, whether I be
lost or saved, I will always continue to act
purely for the love of* :sc:`God`. *I shall have this
good at least, that till death I shall have done
all that is in me to love Him.* That this
trouble of mind had lasted four years, during
which time he had suffered much.

That since that time he had passed his life
in perfect liberty and continual joy. That he
placed his sins betwixt him and :sc:`God`, as it
were to tell Him that he did not deserve His
favours; but that :sc:`God` still continued to
bestow them in abundance.

That in order to form a habit of conversing
with :sc:`God` continually, and referring all we do
to Him; we must at first apply to Him with
some diligence: but that after a little care we
should find His love inwardly excite us to it
without any difficulty.

That he expected, after the pleasant days
:sc:`God` had given him, he should have his turn
of pain and suffering; but that he was not
uneasy about it, knowing very well, that as
he could do nothing of himself, :sc:`God` would
not fail to give him the strength to bear them.

That when an occasion of practising some
virtue offered, he addressed himself to :sc:`God`,
saying, :sc:`Lord`, *I cannot do this unless Thou
enablest me*: and that then he received
strength more than sufficient.

That when he had failed in his duty, he
simply confessed his fault, saying to :sc:`God`, *I
shall never do otherwise, if Thou leavest me to
myself; ’tis Thou must hinder my falling, and
mend what is amiss*. That after this, he gave
himself no farther uneasiness about it.

That we ought to act with :sc:`God` in the
greatest simplicity, speaking to Him frankly
and plainly, and imploring His assistance in
our affairs, just as they happen. That :sc:`God`
never failed to grant it, as he had often
experienced.

That he had been lately sent into Burgundy
to buy the provision of wine for the Society,
which was a very unwelcome task to him,
because he had no turn for business, and
because he was lame, and could not go about
the boat but by rolling himself over the casks.
That, however, he gave himself no uneasiness
about it, nor about the purchase of the wine.
That he said to :sc:`God`, *It was His business he
was about*; and that he afterwards found it
very well performed. That he had been sent
into Auvergne the year before upon the same
account; that he could not tell how the matter
passed, but that it proved very well.

So, likewise, in his business in the kitchen
(to which he had naturally a great aversion),
having accustomed himself to do everything
there for the love of :sc:`God`, and with prayer,
upon all occasions, for His grace to do his
work well, he had found everything easy
during the fifteen years that he had been
employed there.

That he was very well pleased with the
post he was now in; but that he was as ready
to quit that as the former, since he was
always finding pleasure in every condition by
doing little things for the love of :sc:`God`.

That with him the *set* times of prayer were
not different from other times. That he
retired to pray according to the directions of
his Superior: but that he did not want such
retirement, nor ask for it, because his greatest
business did not divert him from :sc:`God`.

That as he knew his obligation to love
:sc:`God` in all things, and as he endeavoured so
to do, he had no need of a “director” to advise
him; but that he needed much a “confessor”
to absolve him. That he was very sensible
of his faults, but not discouraged by them:
that he confessed them to :sc:`God`, and did not
plead against Him to excuse them. When
he had so done, he peaceably resumed his
usual practice of love and adoration.

That in his trouble of mind, he had consulted
nobody: but knowing only by the
light of faith that :sc:`God` was present, he contented
himself with directing all his actions
to Him, *i.e.* doing them with a desire to
please Him, let what would come of it.

That useless thoughts spoil all: that the
mischief began there: but that we ought to
be diligent to reject them as soon as we
perceived their impertinence to the matter in
hand, or to our salvation, and return to our
communion with :sc:`God`.

That at the beginning he had often passed
his time appointed for prayer, in rejecting
wandering thoughts and falling back into
them. That he could never regulate his
devotion by certain methods, as some do.
That, nevertheless, at first he had *meditated*
for some time, but afterwards that went off,
in a manner that he could give no account of.

That all bodily mortifications and other
exercises are useless, but as they serve to
arrive at the union with :sc:`God` by love: that
he had well considered this, and found it the
shortest way, to go straight to Him by a
continual practice of love, and doing all
things for His sake.

That we ought to make a great difference
between the acts of the *understanding* and
those of the *will*; that the first were
comparatively of little value, and the others all.
That our only business was to love and
delight ourselves in :sc:`God`.

That all possible kinds of mortification, if
they were void of the love of :sc:`God`, could not
efface a single sin. That we ought, without
anxiety, to expect the pardon of our sins
from the Blood of :sc:`Jesus Christ`, labouring
simply to love Him with all our hearts. That
:sc:`God` seemed to have granted the greatest
favours to the greatest sinners, as more signal
monuments of His mercy.

That the greatest pains or pleasures of this
world were not to be compared with what he
had experienced of both kinds in a spiritual
state: so that he was careful for nothing,
and feared nothing, desiring but one thing
only of :sc:`God`, viz., that he might not offend
Him.

That he had no qualms; for said he, when
I *fail* in my duty, I readily acknowledge it,
saying, *I am used to do so: I shall never do
otherwise, if I am left to myself*. If I fail not,
then I give :sc:`God` thanks, acknowledging that
it comes from Him.




THIRD CONVERSATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        *November 22nd, 1666*

He told me, that the *foundation of the
spiritual life* in *him* had been a high notion
and esteem of :sc:`God` in faith; which when he
had once well conceived, he had no other
care, but faithfully to reject at once every
other thought, *that he might perform all his
actions for the love of* :sc:`God`. That when
sometimes he had not thought of :sc:`God` for a good
while, he did not disquiet himself for it; but
after having acknowledged his wretchedness
to :sc:`God`, he returned to Him with so much
the greater trust in Him, by how much he
found himself more wretched to have
forgot Him.

That the trust we put in :sc:`God` honours Him
much, and draws down great graces.

That it was impossible, not only that :sc:`God`
should deceive, but also that He should long
let a soul suffer which is perfectly surrendered
to Him, and resolved to endure everything
for His sake.

That he had so often experienced the
ready succour of Divine Grace upon all
occasions, that from the same experience,
when he had business to do, he did not think
of it beforehand; but when it was time to do
it, he found in :sc:`God`, as in a clear mirror, all
that was fit for him to do. That of late he
had acted thus, without anticipating care;
but before the experience above mentioned, he
had been full of care and anxiety in his affairs.

That he had no recollection of what things
he had done, once they were past, and hardly
realised them when he was about them: that
on leaving table, he knew not what he had
been eating; but that with one single end in
view, he did all for the love of :sc:`God`, rendering
Him thanks for that He had directed these
acts, and an infinity of others throughout
his life: he did all very simply, in a manner
which kept him ever steadfastly in the loving
Presence of :sc:`God`.

When outward business diverted him a
little from the thought of :sc:`God`, a fresh
remembrance coming from :sc:`God` invested his
soul, and so inflamed and transported him,
that it was difficult for him to restrain
himself.

That he was more united to :sc:`God` in his
ordinary occupations, than when he left them
for devotion in retirement, from which he
knew himself to issue with much dryness of
spirit.

That he expected hereafter some great
pain of body or mind; that the worst that
could happen to him would be to lose that
sense of :sc:`God`, which he had enjoyed so long;
but that the goodness of :sc:`God` assured him
that He would not forsake him utterly, and
that He would give him strength to bear
whatever evil He permitted to befall him:
and that he therefore feared nothing, and had
no occasion to take counsel with anybody
about his soul. That when he had attempted
to do it, he had always come away more
perplexed; and that as he was conscious of
his readiness to lay down his life for the love
of :sc:`God`, he had no apprehension of danger.
That perfect abandonment to :sc:`God` was the
sure way to heaven, a way on which we had
always sufficient light for our conduct.

That in the beginning of the spiritual life,
we ought to be faithful in doing our duty and
denying ourselves; but after that, unspeakable
pleasures followed. That in difficulties we
need only have recourse to :sc:`Jesus Christ`,
and beg His grace, with which everything
became easy.

That many do not advance in the Christian
progress because they stick in penances and
particular exercises, while they neglect the
love of :sc:`God` which is the *end*; that this
appeared plainly by their works, and was the
reason why we see so little solid virtue.

That there was need neither of art nor
science for going to :sc:`God`, but only a heart
resolutely determined to apply itself to
nothing but Him, or for *His* sake, and to
love Him only.




FOURTH CONVERSATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        *November 25th, 1667*

He discoursed with me fervently and
with great openness of heart, concerning his
manner of *going to* :sc:`God`, whereof some part is
related already.

He told me, that all consists *in one hearty
renunciation* of everything which we are
sensible does not lead us to :sc:`God`, in order
that we may accustom ourselves to a
continual conversation with Him, without
mystery and in simplicity. That we need
only to recognise :sc:`God` intimately present
with us, and to address ourselves to Him
every moment, that we may beg His assistance
for getting to know His will in things
doubtful, and for rightly performing those
which we plainly see He requires of us;
offering them to Him before we do them, and
giving to Him thanks when we have done.

That in this conversation with :sc:`God`, we are
also employed in praising, adoring, and
loving him unceasingly, for His infinite
goodness and perfection.

That without being discouraged on account
of our sins, we should pray for His grace with
a perfect confidence, relying upon the infinite
merits of :sc:`Our Lord`. That :sc:`God` never
failed offering us His grace at every action:
that he distinctly perceived it, and never
failed of it, unless when his thoughts had
wandered from a sense of :sc:`God’s` Presence,
or he had forgotten to ask His assistance.

That :sc:`God` always gave us light in our
doubts, when we had no other design but to
please Him, and to act for His love.

That our sanctification did not depend upon
changing our works, but in doing that for
:sc:`God’s` sake, which we commonly do for our
own. That it was lamentable to see how
many people mistook the means for the end,
addicting themselves to certain works, which
they performed very imperfectly, by reason
of their human or selfish regards.

That the most excellent method which he
had found of going to :sc:`God`, was that of
*doing our common business* without any view
of pleasing men [1]_\ , and (as far as we are
capable) *purely for the love of* :sc:`God`.

.. [1] Gal. i.10; Eph. vi. 5, 6.

That it was a great delusion to think that
the times of prayer ought to differ from other
times: that we were as strictly obliged to
adhere to :sc:`God` by action in the time of action
as by prayer in its season.

That his view of prayer was nothing else
but a sense of the Presence of :sc:`God`, his soul
being at that time insensible to everything
but Divine Love. That when the appointed
times of prayer were past, he found no
difference, because he still continued with
:sc:`God`, praising and blessing Him with all his
might, so that he passed his life in continual
joy; yet hoped that :sc:`God` would give him
somewhat to suffer, when he should have
grown stronger.

That we ought, once for all, heartily to put
our whole trust in :sc:`God`, and make a full
surrender of ourselves to Him, secure that He
would not deceive us.

That we ought not to be weary of doing little
things for the love of :sc:`God`, for He regards
not the greatness of the work, but the love
with which it is performed. That we should
not wonder if, in the beginning, we often
failed in our endeavours; but that, at last,
we should gain a habit, which would naturally
produce its acts in us, without our care, and
to our exceeding great delight.

That the whole substance of religion was
faith, hope, and love; by the practice of
which we become united to the will of :sc:`God`:
that all beside is indifferent, and to be used
only as a means, that we may arrive at our
end, and be swallowed up therein, by faith
and love.

That all things are possible to him who
*believes*, that they are less difficult to him who
*hopes*, they are more easy to him who *loves*,
and still more easy to him who perseveres in
the practice of these three virtues.

That the end we ought to propose to
ourselves, is to become, in this life, the most
perfect worshippers of :sc:`God` we can possibly
be, as we hope to be through all eternity.

That when we enter upon the spiritual life,
we should consider and examine to the
bottom, what we are. And then we should
find ourselves worthy of all contempt, and
such as do not deserve the name of Christians,
subject to all kinds of misery, and numberless
accidents which trouble us, and cause
perpetual vicissitudes in our health, in our
humours, in our internal and external dispositions:
in fine, persons whom :sc:`God` would
humble by many pains and labours, as well
within as without. After this, we should
not wonder that troubles, temptations,
oppositions, and contradictions happen to us
from men. We ought, on the contrary, to
submit ourselves to them, and bear them as
long as :sc:`God` pleases, as things highly
beneficial to us.

That the higher perfection a soul aspires
after, the more dependent it is upon Divine
grace.

[2]_\ Being questioned by one of his own
Society (to whom he was obliged to open
himself) by what means he had attained to
such an habitual sense of :sc:`God`, he told him
that, since his first coming to the monastery,
he had considered :sc:`God` as the *end* of all his
thoughts and desires, as the mark to which
they should tend, and in which they should
terminate.

That in the beginning of his noviciate, he
spent the hours appointed for private prayer
in thinking of :sc:`God`, so as to convince his
mind of, and to impress deeply upon his
heart, the Divine existence, rather by devout
sentiments, than by studied reasonings and
elaborate meditations. That by this short
and sure method, he exercised himself in
the knowledge and love of :sc:`God`, resolving to
use his utmost endeavour to live in a
continual sense of His Presence, and, if possible,
never to forget Him more.

That when he had thus in prayer filled his
mind full with great sentiments of that
:sc:`Infinite Being`, he went to his work
appointed in the kitchen (for he was cook to
the Society); there having first considered
severally the things his office required, and
when and how each thing was to be done, he
spent all the intervals of his time, as well
before as after his work, in prayer.

That, when he began his business, he said
to :sc:`God`, with a filial trust in Him: “:sc:`O my
God`, since Thou art with me, and I must
now, in obedience to Thy commands, apply
my mind to these outward things, I beseech
Thee to grant me the grace to continue in Thy
Presence; and to this end, do Thou prosper
me with Thy assistance, receive all my works,
and possess all my affections.”

As he proceeded in his work, he continued
his familiar conversation with his Maker,
imploring His grace, and offering to Him all
his actions.

When he had finished, he examined himself
how he had discharged his duty: if he found
*well*, he returned thanks to :sc:`God`: if otherwise,
he asked pardon; and without being
discouraged, he set his mind right again and
continued his exercise of the *Presence of* :sc:`God`,
as if he had never deviated from it. “Thus,”
said he, “by rising after my falls, and by
frequently renewed acts of faith and love, I
am come to a state, wherein it would be as
difficult for me not to think of :sc:`God`, as it
was at first to accustom myself to it.”

As Brother Lawrence had found such
comfort and blessing in walking in the
Presence of :sc:`God`, it was natural for him to
recommend it earnestly to others; but his
example was a stronger inducement than any
arguments he could propose. His very
countenance was edifying; such a sweet and
calm devotion appearing in it, as could not
but affect all beholders. And it was observed,
that in the greatest hurry of business in the
kitchen, he still preserved his recollection and
his heavenly-mindedness. He was never
hasty nor loitering, but did each thing in its
season, with an even, uninterrupted composure
and tranquillity of spirit. “The time of
business,” said he, “does not with me differ
from the time of prayer, and in the noise
and clatter of my kitchen, while several
persons are at the same time calling for
different things, I possess :sc:`God` in as great
tranquillity, as if I were upon my knees at
the Blessed Sacrament.”

.. [2] The particulars which follow are collected from other
       accounts of Brother Lawrence.




LETTERS
===============================================================================




FIRST LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Reverend Mother`

[3]_\ :sc:`My Reverend Mother`,---Since you desire
so earnestly that I should communicate to
you the method by which I arrived at that
*habitual sense of* :sc:`God’s` *Presence*, which :sc:`Our
Lord`, of His mercy, has been pleased to
vouchsafe to me, I must tell you, that it is
with great difficulty that I am prevailed on
by your importunities, and now I do it only
upon the terms, that you show my letter to
nobody. If I knew that you would let it be
seen, all the desire that I have for your
perfection would not be able to determine me
to it.

The account I can give you is this. Having
found in many books different methods
prescribed of going to :sc:`God`, and divers practices
of the spiritual life, I thought this would
serve rather to puzzle me, than facilitate
what I sought after, which was nothing else,
but how to become wholly :sc:`God’s`. This
made me resolve to give the *all* for the *all*:
so after having given myself wholly to :sc:`God`,
to make all the satisfaction I could for my
sins, *I renounced, for the love of Him, everything
that was not His; and I began to live, as if
there was none but He and I in the world*.
Sometimes I considered myself before Him,
as a poor criminal at the feet of his judge;
at other times, I beheld Him in my heart as
my :sc:`Father`, as my :sc:`God`; I worshipped Him
the oftenest that I could, keeping my mind
in His holy Presence, and recalling it as often
as I found it wandering from Him. I found
no small trouble in this exercise, and yet I
continued it, notwithstanding all the difficulties
that I encountered, without troubling or
disquieting myself when my mind had
wandered involuntarily. I made this my
business, as much all the day long as at the
appointed times of prayer; for at all times,
every hour, every minute, even in the height
of my business, I drove away from my mind
everything that was capable of interrupting
my thought of :sc:`God`.

Such has been my common practice ever
since I entered into religion; and though I
have done it very imperfectly, yet I have
found great advantages by it. These, I well
know, are to be imputed solely to the mercy
and goodness of :sc:`God`, because we can do
nothing without Him; and *I* still less than
any. But when we are faithful to keep
ourselves in His Holy Presence, and set Him
always before us; this not only hinders our
offending Him, and doing anything that may
displease Him, at least wilfully, but it also
begets in us a holy freedom, and, if I may so
speak, a familiarity with :sc:`God`, wherewith we
ask, and that successfully, the graces we stand
in need of. In fine, by often repeating these
acts, they become *habitual*, and the *Presence
of* :sc:`God` is rendered as it were *natural* to us.
Give Him thanks, if you please, with me for
His great goodness towards me, which I can
never sufficiently marvel at, for the many
favours He has done to so miserable a
sinner as I am. May all things praise Him.
Amen.---I am, in :sc:`Our Lord`, Yours, etc.

SECOND LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Reverend Mother`

:sc:`My Reverend Mother`,---I have taken this
opportunity to communicate to you the
thoughts of one of our Society, concerning
the wonderful effect and continual succour
which he receives from *the Presence of* :sc:`God`.
Let you and me both profit by them.

You must know that during the forty years
and more that he has spent in religion, his
continual care has been to be *always with*
:sc:`God`; and to do nothing, say nothing, and
think nothing which may displease Him;
and this without any other view than purely
for the love of Him, and because He deserves
infinitely more.

He is now so accustomed to that *Divine
Presence*, that he receives from it continual
succour upon all occasions. For above
thirty years, his soul has been filled with
joys so continual and sometimes so
transcendent, that he is forced to use means to
moderate them and to prevent their appearing
outwardly.

If sometimes he is a little too much absent
from that *Divine Presence*, which happens
often when he is most engaged in his
outward business, :sc:`God` presently makes Himself
felt in his soul to recall him. He answers
with exact fidelity to these inward drawings,
either by an elevation of his heart towards
:sc:`God`, or by a meek and loving regard to Him,
or by such words as love forms upon these
occasions, as for instance, :sc:`My God`, *behold me,
wholly Thine:* :sc:`Lord`, *make me according to
Thy heart.* And then it seems to him (as in
effect he feels it) that this :sc:`God` of love,
satisfied with such few words, reposes again
and rests in the depth and centre of his soul.
The experience of these things gives him such
an assurance that :sc:`God` is always deep within
his soul, that no doubt of it can arise,
whatever may betide.

Judge by this what contentment and
satisfaction he enjoys, feeling continually
within him so great a treasure: no longer is
he in anxious search after it, but he has it
open before him, free to take of it what he
pleases.

He complains much of our blindness and
exclaims often that we are to be pitied, who
content ourselves with so little. :sc:`God’s`
*treasure*, he says, *is like an infinite ocean, yet
a little wave of feeling, passing with the moment,
contents us. Blind as we are, we hinder* :sc:`God`,
*and stop the current of His graces. But when
He finds a soul permeated with a living faith,
He pours into it His graces and His favours
plenteously; into the soul they flow like a torrent,
which, after being forcibly stopped against its
ordinary course, when it has found a passage,
spreads with impetuosity its pent-up flood.*

Yes, often we stop this torrent, by the little
value we set upon it. But let us stop it no
longer: let us enter into ourselves and break
down the barrier which holds it back. Let
us make the most of the day of grace, let us
redeem the time that is lost, perhaps we
have but little left to us: death follows close,
let us be well prepared; for we die but once,
and a miscarriage *then* is irretrievable.

I say again, let us enter into ourselves.
Time presses: there is no room for delay,
our souls are at stake. You, I believe, have
taken such effectual measures, that you will
not be surprised. I commend you for it, it is
the one thing needful: we must, nevertheless,
always labour at it; for, in the spiritual life,
not to advance is to go back. But those
whose spirits are stirred by the breath of the
:sc:`Holy Spirit` go forward, even in sleep. If
the bark of our soul is still tossed with the
winds and the storms, let us awake the Lord,
Who reposes in it, and quickly He will calm
the sea.

I have taken the liberty to impart to you
these good thoughts, that you may compare
them with your own. They will serve to
rekindle and inflame them, if by misfortune
(which :sc:`God` forbid, for it would be indeed a
great evil) they should, though never so little,
be somewhat cooled. Let us then *both* recall
our *early* fervour. Let us profit by the
example and thoughts of this brother, who is
little known of the world, but known of :sc:`God`,
and in untold measure caressed by Him. I
will pray for you, do you pray instantly
for him, who is, in :sc:`Our Lord`,---Yours, etc.

THIRD LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Reverend Mother`

:sc:`My Reverend and Greatly Honoured
Mother`,---I have received to-day two books
and a letter from Sister ---, who is
preparing to make her “profession,” and upon that
account desires the prayers of your holy
Community, and yours in particular. I
perceive that she reckons much upon them;
pray do not disappoint her. Beg of :sc:`God`
that she may make her sacrifice in the view
of His love alone, and with a firm resolution to
be wholly devoted to Him. I will send you
one of those books which treat of *the
Presence of* :sc:`God`, a subject which in my
opinion contains the whole spiritual life. It
seems to me, that whosoever duly practises
it, will soon become spiritual.

I know that for the right practice of it, the
heart must be empty of all else; because
:sc:`God` wills to possess the heart *alone*: and as
He cannot possess it alone unless it be empty
of all besides, so He cannot work in it what
He would, unless it be left vacant to Him.

There is not in the world a kind of life
more sweet and more delightful, than that of
a continual walk with :sc:`God`; those only can
comprehend it, who practise and experience
it. Yet I do not advise you to do it from
that motive, it is not pleasure which we ought
to seek in this exercise; but let us do it from
the motive of love, and because :sc:`God` would
have us so walk.

Were I a preacher, I should preach above
all other things, the practice of *the Presence
of* :sc:`God`: were I a “director,” I should advise
all the world to it; so necessary do I think it,
and so easy.

Ah! knew we but the need we have of the
grace and succour of :sc:`God`, we should
never lose sight of Him, no, not for one
moment. Believe me; this very instant, make
a holy and firm resolution, never again wilfully
to stray from Him, and to live the rest of your
days *in His Holy Presence*, for love of Him
surrendering, if He think fit, all other pleasures.

Set heartily about this work, and if you
perform it as you ought, be assured that you
will soon find the effects of it. I will assist
you with my prayers, poor as they are. I
commend myself earnestly to yours, and to
those of your holy Community, being theirs,
and more particularly,---Yours, etc.

    *1685*




FOURTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Same`

:sc:`My Reverend and Greatly Honoured
Mother`,---I have received from Mdlle.le---
the chaplets which you gave her for me. I
wonder that you have not given me your
thoughts of the little book I sent to you, and
which you must have received. Pray, set
heartily about the practice of it in your old
age; it is better late than never.

I cannot imagine how religious persons can
live satisfied without the practice of *the
Presence of* :sc:`God`. For my part, as I can, I
keep myself retired with Him in the very
centre of my soul; and, when I am so with
Him, I fear no evil; but the least turning
away from Him is to me insupportable.

This exercise does not much fatigue the
body; yet it is proper to deprive it
sometimes, nay often, of many little pleasures,
which are innocent and lawful. For :sc:`God`
will not suffer a soul, which would fain be
wholly devoted to Him, to take other
pleasures than with Him: that is more than
reasonable.

I do not say that for this cause we must
place any violent constraint upon ourselves.
No, we must serve :sc:`God` in a holy freedom,
we must do our business faithfully,
without trouble or disquiet; recalling our minds
to :sc:`God` meekly, and with tranquillity, as often
as we find them wandering from Him.

It is, however, needful to put our whole
trust in :sc:`God`, laying aside all other cares,
and even some particular forms of devotion,
very good in themselves, but yet such as one
often engages in unreasonably: because, in
fact, those devotions are only means to attain
to the end, so when by this practice of *the
Presence of* :sc:`God` we are *with Him* Who is
*our End*, it is then useless to return to the
means. Then it is that abiding in His Holy
Presence, we may continue our commerce of
love, now by an act of adoration, of praise, or
of desire; now by an act of sacrifice or of
thanksgiving, and in all the manners which
our mind can devise.


Be not discouraged by the repugnance
which you may find to it from nature; you
must do yourself violence. Often, at the
outset, one thinks it is lost time; but you
must go on, and resolve to persevere in it
till death, despite all difficulties. I commend
myself to the prayers of your holy
Community, and to yours in particular.---I am, in
:sc:`Our Lord`, yours, etc.

    *November 3rd, 1685*




FIFTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To Madame` ---

:sc:`Madame`,---I pity you much. It will be of the
greatest moment, if you can leave the care of
your affairs to M. and Mme. --- and spend the
remainder of your life only in worshipping
:sc:`God`. He lays no great burden upon us,---a
little remembrance of Him from time to time,
a little adoration; sometimes to pray for His
grace, sometimes to offer Him your sorrows,
sometimes to return Him thanks for the
benefits He hath bestowed upon you and is
still bestowing in the midst of your troubles.
He asks you to console yourself with Him
the oftenest you can. Lift up your heart to
Him even at your meals, or when you are in
company,---the least little remembrance will
always be acceptable to Him. You need not
cry very loud: He is nearer to us than we think.

To be with :sc:`God`, there is no need to be
continually in church. Of our heart we may
make an Oratory, wherein to retire from time
to time and with Him hold meek, humble,
loving converse. Everyone can converse
closely with :sc:`God`, some more, others less:
He knows what we can do. Let us begin
then; perhaps He is just waiting for one
generous resolution on our part; let us be
brave. So little time remains to us to live;
you are near sixty-four, and I am almost
eighty. Let us live and die with :sc:`God`: sufferings
will be ever sweet and pleasant to us,
while we abide with Him; and without Him,
the greatest pleasures will be but cruel anguish.
May He be blessed for all. Amen.

Accustom yourself, then, by degrees, to
worship Him with your whole strength, to
beg His grace, to offer Him your heart, from
time to time throughout the day’s business,
even every moment, if you can. Do not
scrupulously confine yourself to fixed rules
or particular forms of devotion; but act with
faith in :sc:`God`, with love, and with humility.
You can assure M. and Mme. and Mdlle.
--- of my poor prayers, and that I am their
servant, and in particular, in :sc:`Our Lord`,---Your
Brother, etc.





SIXTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class: align-center

        :sc:`To The Reverend Father`

:sc:`My Reverend Father`,---Not finding my
manner of life in books, although I have no
difficulty about it, yet, for greater security, I
shall be glad to know your thoughts
concerning it.

In a conversation some days since with a
person of piety, he told me that the spiritual
life was a life of grace, which begins with
servile fear, which is increased by hope of
eternal life, and which is consummated by
pure love. That each of these states had its
different stages, by which one arrives at last
at that blessed consummation.

I have not followed all these methods. On
the contrary, from I know not what instincts, I
found that they discouraged me. This was
the reason why, at my entrance into religion,
I took a resolution to give myself up to :sc:`God`,
as the best satisfaction I could make for my
sins, and for the love of Him to renounce all
besides.

For the first years, I commonly employed
myself during the time set apart for devotion
with the thoughts of death, judgement, hell,
heaven, and my sins. Thus I continued some
years, applying my mind carefully the rest of
the day, and even in the midst of my business,
*to the presence of* :sc:`God`, Whom I considered
always as *with* me, often as *in* me.

At length I came insensibly to do the same
thing during my set time of prayer, which
caused in me great delight and consolation.
This practice produced in me so high an
esteem for :sc:`God`, that *faith* alone was capable
to satisfy me in that point [4]_\ .

.. [4] *I suppose he means*, that all distinct notions he could
       form of :sc:`God` were unsatisfactory, because he perceived them
       to be unworthy of :sc:`God`; and therefore his mind was not to
       be satisfied but by the views of *faith*, which apprehends :sc:`God`
       as infinite and incomprehensible, as He is in Himself, and
       not as He can be conceived by human ideas.

Such was my beginning; and yet I must
tell you, that for the first ten years I suffered
much: the apprehension that I was not
devoted to :sc:`God`, as I wished to be, my past
sins always present to my mind, and the great
unmerited favours which :sc:`God` bestowed on
me, were the matter and source of my sufferings.
During all this time I fell often, yet as
often rose again. It seemed to me that all
creation, reason, and :sc:`God` Himself were
against me; and *faith* alone for me. I was
troubled sometimes with thoughts, that to
believe I had received such favours, was an
effect of my presumption, which pretended to
be *at once* where others arrive only with
difficulty; at other times that it was a wilful
delusion and that there was no salvation for
me.

When I thought of nothing but to end my
days in these times of trouble and disquiet
(which did not at all diminish the trust I had
in :sc:`God`, and which served only to increase
my faith), I found myself changed all at once;
and my soul, which till that time was in
trouble, felt a profound inward peace, as if it
had found its centre and place of rest.

Ever since that time, I have been and am
now walking before :sc:`God` in simple faith, with
humility, and with love; and I apply myself
diligently to do nothing, say nothing, and
think nothing which may displease Him. I
hope that when I have done what I can, He
will do with me what He pleases.

As for what passes in me at present, I
cannot express it. I have no pain nor any
doubt as to my state, because I have no will
but that of :sc:`God`, which I endeavour to carry
out in all things, and to which I am so submissive
that I would not take up a straw from
the ground against His order, or from any
other motive but purely that of love to Him.

I have quitted all forms of devotion and
set prayers, save those to which my state
obliges me. And I make it my only business
only to persevere in His Holy Presence,
wherein I keep myself by a simple attention
and an absorbing passionate regard to :sc:`God`,
which I may call an *actual Presence of* :sc:`God`;
or to speak better, a silent and secret, constant
intercourse of the soul with :sc:`God`, which often
causes in me joys and raptures inwardly, and
sometimes also outwardly, so great, that I am
forced to use means to moderate them, and
prevent their appearance to others.

In short, I am assured beyond all doubt,
that my soul has been with :sc:`God` these past
thirty years and more. I pass over many
things that I may not be tedious to you;
yet I think it proper to inform you after what
manner I consider myself before :sc:`God`, Whom
I behold as my *King*.

I consider myself as the most wretched of
men, full of sores and corruption, and as one
who has committed all sorts of crimes against
his King; moved with deep sorrow, I confess
to Him all my wickedness, I ask His forgiveness,
I abandon myself in His hands, that
He may do with me what He pleases. This
King, full of mercy and goodness, very far
from chastising me, embraces me with love,
makes me to eat at His table, serves me with
His own hands, gives me the key of His
treasures; He converses and delights Himself
with me unceasingly, in a thousand and
a thousand ways, and treats me in all respects
as His favourite. It is thus that I consider myself
from time to time in His Holy Presence.

My most usual method is this simple
attention, and this absorbing, passionate regard
to :sc:`God`, to Whom I find myself often attached
with greater sweetness and delight, than that
of an infant at his mother’s breast: so that, if
I dare use the expression, I should choose to
call this state the bosom of :sc:`God`, by reason of
the inexpressible sweetness which I taste and
experience there. If sometimes my thoughts
wander from it by necessity or by infirmity,
I am soon recalled by inward emotions, so
charming and delightful that I am confused
to mention them.

I beg you to reflect rather upon my great
wretchedness, of which you are fully informed,
than upon the great favours which
:sc:`God` does me, all unworthy and ungrateful as
I am.

As for my set hours of prayer, they are
only a continuation of the same exercise.
Sometimes I consider myself as a stone in
the hands of a carver, whereof he wills to
make a statue: presenting myself thus before
:sc:`God`, I beseech Him to render me entirely
like Himself, and to fashion in my soul His
Perfect Image.

At other times so soon as I apply myself
to prayer, I feel my whole spirit and my
whole soul lift itself up without any trouble
or effort of mine; and it remains as it were in
elevation, fixed firm in :sc:`God` as in its centre
and its resting-place.

I know that some charge this state with
inactivity, delusion, and self-love. I avow
that it is a holy inactivity, and would be
a happy self-love, were the soul in that state
capable of such; because, in fact, while the soul
is in this repose, it cannot be troubled by such
acts, as it was formerly accustomed to, and
which were then its support, but which would
now rather injure than assist it.

Yet I cannot bear that this should be called
delusion; because the soul which thus enjoys
:sc:`God`, desires herein nothing but Him. If
this be delusion in me, it is for :sc:`God` to
remedy it. May He do with me what He
pleases: I desire only Him, and would fain
be wholly devoted to Him. You will, however,
oblige me in sending me your opinion,
to which I always pay great deference, for I
have a very special esteem for your Reverence,
and, am, in :sc:`Our Lord`, my Reverend
Father,---Yours, etc.




SEVENTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Reverend Mother`

:sc:`My Reverend and Greatly Honoured
Mother`,---My prayers, of little worth though
they be, will not fail you; I have promised
it, and I will keep my word. How happy we
might be, if only we could find the Treasure,
of which the Gospel tells us,---all else would
seem to us nothing. How infinite it is!
The more one toils and searches in it, the
greater are the riches that one finds. Let us
toil therefore unceasingly in this search, and
let us not grow weary and leave off, till we
have found. [Then follow some private
matters, after which the writer goes on to say],

I know not what I shall become: it seems
to me that peace of soul and repose of spirit
descend on me, even in sleep. To be without
the sense of this peace, would be affliction
indeed; but with this calm in my soul even
for purgatory I would console myself.

I know not what :sc:`God` purposes with me,
or keeps me for; I am in a calm so great that
I fear nought. What can I fear, when I am
with Him? And with Him, in His Presence,
I hold myself the most I can. May all
things praise Him. Amen.---Yours, etc.




EIGHTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To Madame` ---

:sc:`Madame`,---We have a :sc:`God` Who is infinitely
gracious, and knows all our wants. I always
thought that He would reduce you to
extremity. He will come in His own time,
and when you least expect it. Hope in
Him more than ever: thank Him with me
for the favours He does you, particularly
for the fortitude and patience which He gives
you in your afflictions; it is a plain mark of
the care He has of you; comfort yourself
therefore with Him, and give thanks for all.

I admire also the fortitude and bravery of
M. de ---. :sc:`God` has given him a good
disposition, and a good will; but there is in
him still a little of the world and a great
deal of youth. I hope that the affliction,
which :sc:`God` has sent him, will prove to him
a wholesome medicine, and make him take
stock of himself. It is an occasion very
proper to engage him to put all his confidence
in *Him*, Who accompanies him everywhere:
let him think of Him the oftenest he can,
especially in the greatest dangers.

A little lifting up the heart suffices; a
little remembrance of :sc:`God`, one act of inward
worship, though upon a march and sword in
hand, are prayers which, however short, are
nevertheless very acceptable to :sc:`God`; and
far from lessening a soldier’s courage, they
best serve to fortify it.

Let him then think of :sc:`God` the most he
can. Let him accustom himself by degrees
to this small but holy exercise; nobody
perceives it, and nothing is easier than to
repeat often in the day these little acts of
inward worship. Recommend to him, if you
please, that he think of :sc:`God` the most he can,
in the manner here directed: it is very fit
and most necessary for a soldier, who is daily
exposed to dangers of life and often of his
salvation. I hope that :sc:`God` will assist him
and all the family, to whom I present my
service, being theirs and in particular, --- Yours,
etc.

    *October 12th, 1688*




NINTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Reverend Mother`

:sc:`My Reverend and Greatly Honoured
Mother`,---You tell me nothing new: you
are not the only one that is troubled with
wandering thoughts. Our mind is extremely
roving; but as the will is mistress of all our
faculties, she must recall it, and carry it to
:sc:`God`, as its last End.

When the mind, for lack of discipline when
first we engaged in devotion, has contracted
bad habits of wandering and dissipation, such
habits are difficult to overcome, and
commonly draw us, even against our will, to
things of earth.

I believe that one remedy for this is to
confess our faults, and to humble ourselves
before :sc:`God`. I do not advise you to use
multiplicity of words in prayer; discursive
forms are often the occasion of wandering.
Hold yourself in prayer before :sc:`God`, like a
poor, dumb, paralytic beggar at a rich man’s
gate. Let it be *your business* to keep your
mind in *the Presence of the* :sc:`Lord`: if it
sometimes wanders and withdraws itself from
Him, do not much disquiet yourself for that;
trouble and disquiet serve rather to distract
than to recall the mind; the will must bring
it back in tranquillity: if you persevere with
your whole strength, :sc:`God` will have pity on
you.

One way to recall easily the mind in time
of prayer, and preserve it more in rest, is
not to let it wander too far at other times.
You should keep it strictly in *the Presence
of* :sc:`God`, and being accustomed to think of
Him often from time to time, you will find
it easy to keep your mind calm in the time
of prayer, or at least to recall it from its
wanderings.

I have told you already at large in my
other letters of the benefits we may draw
from this practice of *the Presence of* :sc:`God`.
Let us set about it seriously, and pray for one
another. I commend myself to the prayers
of Sister ---, and of the Reverend Mother
---, and am, --- Yours in :sc:`Our Lord`, etc.




TENTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Same`

:sc:`The` enclosed is an answer to that which I
have received from our good Sister --- ; pray
deliver it to her. She seems to me full of
good will, but she wants to go faster than
grace. One does not become holy all at once.
I commend her to you: we ought to help one
another by our advice, and still more by our
good examples. You will oblige me by
letting me hear of her from time to time, and
whether she be very fervent and very
obedient.

Let us thus think often that our only business
in this life is to please :sc:`God`; that all besides
is perhaps but folly and vanity. You and I
have lived more than forty years in religion.
Have we employed those years in loving and
serving :sc:`God`, Who by His mercy has called
us to this state and for that very end? I am
filled with shame and confusion when I reflect,
on one hand, upon the great favours which
:sc:`God` has bestowed and is still unceasingly
bestowing upon me; and, on the other, upon
the ill use I have made of them, and my
small advancement in the way of perfection.

Since, by His mercy, He gives us still a
little time, let us begin in earnest, let us
redeem the time that is lost, let us return with
a whole-hearted trust to this :sc:`Father` *of
Mercies*, Who is always ready to receive us
into His loving arms. Let us renounce, and
renounce generously, with single heart, for the
love of Him, all that is not His; He deserves
infinitely more. Let us think of Him unceasingly;
in Him let us put all our confidence.
I doubt not but that we shall soon experience
the effects of it in receiving the abundance of
His grace, with which we can do all things,
and without which we can do nought but sin.

We cannot escape the dangers which
abound in life, without the actual and
*continual* help of :sc:`God`; let us then pray to Him
for it continually. How can we pray to Him,
without being with Him? How can we be
with Him, but in thinking of Him often?
And how can we have Him often in our
thoughts, unless by a holy habit of thought
which we should form? You will tell me
that I am always saying the same thing: it is
true, for this is the best and easiest method
that I know; and as I use no other, I advise
the whole world to it. We must *know* before
we can *love*. In order to *know* :sc:`God`, we must
often *think* of Him; and when we come to
*love* Him, we shall *also think* of Him often,
*for our heart will be with our treasure*. I
Ponder over this often, ponder it well. ---
Yours, etc.

ELEVENTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To Madame` ---

:sc:`Madame`,---I have had a good deal of difficulty
to bring myself to write to M. de ---;
and I do it now purely because you and Mme.
de --- desire me. Pray write the directions
and send it to him. I am very well pleased
with the trust you have in :sc:`God`: it is my
wish that He may increase it in you more
and more. We cannot have too much confidence
in so good and faithful a Friend, Who
will never fail us in this world or the next.

If M. de --- knows how to profit by the loss
he has sustained, and puts all his confidence
in :sc:`God`, He will soon give him another friend
more powerful and more inclined to serve
him. He disposes of hearts as He pleases.
Perhaps M. de --- was too much attached to
him he has lost. We ought to love our
friends, but without encroaching upon the
love of :sc:`God`, which must be the chief.

Remember, I pray you, what I have often
recommended to you, which is, often to think
on :sc:`God`, by day, by night, in your business,
and even in your diversions. He is always
near you and with you: leave Him not alone.
You would think it rude to leave a friend
alone, who had come to visit you: why then
must :sc:`God` be neglected? Do not then forget
Him, think often of Him, adore him unceasingly,
live and die with Him: this is the
glorious employment of a Christian, in a
word, this is our profession; if we do not
know it, we must learn it. I will endeavour
to help you with my prayers, and am, in :sc:`Our
Lord`,---Yours, etc.

        :sc:`To The Reverend Mother`

:sc:`My Reverend and Greatly Honoured

and patience to bear them as long as He
pleases. Comfort yourself with Him, Who
holds you fastened to the cross; He will
loose you when He thinks fit. Happy those
who suffer with Him; accustom yourself to
suffer in that manner, and seek from Him the
strength to endure as much and as long as
He shall judge to be needful for you. They
who love the world do not comprehend these
truths, nor do I wonder at it; for they suffer
as lovers of the world, and not as lovers of
Christ. They consider sickness as a pain of
nature and not as a favour from :sc:`God`; and
seeing it only in that light, they find nothing
in it but grief and distress. But they who
trust in sickness as coming from the hand of
:sc:`God`, as the effect of His mercy, and the
means which He employs for their salvation,
commonly find in it great sweetness and
sensible consolation.

I wish you could convince yourself that
:sc:`God` is often nearer to us and more effectually
present with us, in sickness than in health.
Rely upon no other Physician, for according
to my apprehension, He reserves your cure
to Himself. Place all your trust in Him and
you will soon find the effects, which we often
retard by putting greater confidence in physic
than in :sc:`God`.

Whatever remedies you make use of, they
will prove beneficial only so far as He permits.
When pains come from :sc:`God`, He only can
cure them. Often He sends diseases of the
body to cure those of the soul. Comfort
yourself with the sovereign Physician both of
soul and body.

I foresee that you will tell me that I am
very much at my ease, that I eat and drink
at the table of the :sc:`Lord`. You are right:
but think you that it would be a small pain
to the greatest criminal in the world to eat
at his king’s table and to be served by his
king’s hand, without however being assured
of pardon? I believe that he would feel
exceeding great uneasiness, and such as
nothing could moderate, save only his trust
in the goodness of his sovereign. So I can
assure you that whatever pleasures I taste
at the table of my King, my sins ever present
before my eyes, as well as the uncertainty
of my pardon, torment me: though in truth
that torment itself is pleasing.

Be satisfied with the state wherein which :sc:`God`
has placed you: however happy you may
think me, I envy you. Pains and suffering
would be a paradise to me, while I should
suffer with my :sc:`God`; and the greatest
pleasures would be to me a hell, if I could
relish them without Him; all my joy would
be to suffer something for His sake.

In a little time I shall be going to
:sc:`God`, I mean going to render my account to
Him.

In this life, what comforts me is, that I see
God by faith, and indeed in such a manner
as might make me say at time, *No longer I
believe---I see*. I feel what faith teaches us,
and in that assurance, and that practice of
faith I will live and die with Him.

Continue then always with :sc:`God`; it is the
only support and comfort for your affliction.
I shall beseech Him to company with you.
I present my service to the Reverend Mother
Superior, and commend myself to your
prayers, and am, in :sc:`Our Lord`,---Yours, etc.

THIRTEENTH LETTER

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Reverend Mother`

:sc:`My Good Mother`,---If we were well
accustomed to the exercise of *the presence of*
:sc:`God`, all bodily diseases would be much
alleviated thereby. :sc:`God` often permits that
we should suffer a little to purify our souls,
and to compel us to continue *with Him*. I
cannot understand how a soul, which is with
:sc:`God` and which desires Him alone, can feel
pain: I have had enough experience to banish
all doubt that it can.

Take courage, offer to Him unceasingly
your sorrows, pray to Him for strength to
endure. Above all, acquire a habit of holding
constant converse with :sc:`God`, and forget Him
the least you can. Adore Him in your
infirmities, offer yourself to Him from time
to time; and in the very height of your sufferings
beseech Him humbly and lovingly---as
a child his good father---to grant you the aid
of His grace and to make you conformable
to His holy will. I will help you with my
poor halting prayers.

God has many ways of drawing us to Himself.
He hides Himself sometimes from us;
but *faith* alone, which will not fail us in time
of need, ought to be our support and the
foundation of our confidence, which must be
all in :sc:`God`.

I do not know how :sc:`God` will dispose of
me. I am always more happy. The
whole world suffers, yet I, who deserve the
severest discipline, experience joys so
constant and so great, that I can scarce contain
them.

I would willingly ask of :sc:`God` a share of
your sufferings, but that I know my weakness
which is so great, that if He left me one
moment by myself, I should be the most
wretched man alive. And yet I know not
how He can leave me alone, because faith
gives me as strong a conviction as sense can
do, and I know that He never forsakes us, till
we have first forsaken Him. Let us fear to
leave Him. Let us ever abide with Him:
let us live and die with Him. Make you
this petition for me, as I for you.---Yours,
etc.

    *November 28th 1690*




FOURTEENTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Same`

:sc:`My Good Mother`,---I am in pain to see you
suffer so long: what gives me some ease, and
sweetens the sorrow which I have for your
griefs, is that I am convinced that they are
tokens of the love :sc:`God` has for you. Look
at them in this light, and you will bear them
more easily. As your case is, it is my opinion
that you should leave off human remedies,
and resign yourself entirely to the Providence
of :sc:`God`: perhaps He stays only for that
resignation and a perfect trust in Him to
cure you. Since, despite all your cares,
physic has not had the effect it should, but
on the contrary the malady increases, it will
not be tempting :sc:`God` to abandon yourself
into His hands, and look for all to Him.

I told you in my last that sometimes He
permits the body to suffer, to cure the sickness
of our souls. Have courage, then: make of
necessity a virtue; ask of :sc:`God`, not deliverance
from the body’s pains, but strength
bravely to endure, for the love of Him, all
that He shall desire, and as long as He shall
please.

Such prayers, indeed, are a little hard to
nature, but most acceptable to :sc:`God`, and
sweet to those who love Him. Love sweetens
pain: and when one loves :sc:`God`, one suffers
for Him with joy and courage. Do you so,
I beseech you: comfort yourself with Him,
Who is the only Physician of all our ills.
He is the :sc:`Father` of the afflicted, ever ready
to succour us. He loves us infinitely more
than we can imagine: love Him therefore,
and seek no other relief than in Him: I hope
you will soon receive it. Adieu. I will help
you with my prayers, poor as they are, and I
will ever be in :sc:`Our Lord`,---Yours, etc.




FIFTEENTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Same`

:sc:`My Very Dear Mother`,---I render thanks
to :sc:`Our Lord` for having relieved you a little
according to your desire. I have been often
near expiring, though I was never so much
satisfied as then. Accordingly, I did not
pray for any relief, but I prayed for strength
to suffer bravely, meekly, lovingly. Ah!
how sweet it is to suffer with :sc:`God`! However
great may be the sufferings, receive them
with love. ’Tis Paradise to suffer, and to be
with Him; so that, if even now in this life
we would enjoy the peace of Paradise, we
must accustom ourselves to hold familiar,
humble, loving converse with Him: we must
prevent our spirit from ever wandering from
Him: we must make our heart a spiritual
temple, wherein to adore Him unceasingly: we
must watch continually over ourselves, that we
may not do, nor say, nor think anything that
may displease Him. When our minds are
thus filled with :sc:`God`, suffering will become
full of sweetness, of unction, and of quiet
joy.

I know that to arrive at this state, the
beginning is very difficult, for we must act
purely in faith. But hard though it is, we
know also that we can do all things with the
grace of :sc:`God`, which He never refuses to
them who ask Him for it earnestly. Knock,
be instant in knocking, and I answer for it,
He will open to you in His due time, and
grant you in a moment what He has withheld
during the many years. Adieu. Pray to
Him for me, as I pray to Him for you. I
hope to see Him very soon.---I am entirely
yours, in :sc:`Our Lord`.

    *January 22nd, 1691.*




SIXTEENTH LETTER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    .. class:: align-center

        :sc:`To The Same`

:sc:`My Good Mother`,---:sc:`God` knoweth best
what is needful for us, and all that He does
is for our good. If we knew how much He
loves us, we should be always ready to receive
equally, and with indifference, from His hand,
the sweet and the bitter; all would please
that came from Him. The sorest afflictions
never appear intolerable, but when we see
them in the wrong light: when we see them in
the hand of :sc:`God`, Who dispenses them; when
we know that it is our loving :sc:`Father`, Who
abases and distresses us, our sufferings lose
all their bitterness, and our mourning becomes
all joy.

Let all our business be to *know* :sc:`God`: the
more one *knows* Him, the more one *desires to
know* Him. And as *knowledge* is commonly
the measure of *love*, the deeper and more
extensive *our knowledge* shall be, the greater
will be *our love*: and if our love of :sc:`God` be
great, we shall love him equally in grief and
in joy.

Let us not amuse ourselves, to seek or to love
:sc:`God` for any sensible favours (how elevated
soever) which He has done or may do to us.
Such favours, though never so great, cannot
bring us so near to :sc:`God`, as faith does in one
simple act. Let us seek Him often by faith;
He is within us,---seek Him not elsewhere.
Are we not rude and deserving of blame, if
we leave Him alone, to busy ourselves about
trifles, which do not please Him,---which
perhaps offend Him? He bears with them
now, but it is to be feared these trifles will
one day cost us dear.

Let us begin to be devoted to Him in
good earnest. Let us cast everything besides
out of our hearts; He would possess them
alone. Beg this favour of Him. If we do
what we can on our part, we shall soon see
that change wrought in us which we aspire
after. I cannot thank Him sufficiently for
the relief He has vouchsafed you. I hope
from His mercy the favour of seeing Him
within a few days [5]_\ . Let us pray for one
another.---I am, in :sc:`Our Lord`, yours, etc.

    *February 6th, 1691*

.. [5] He took to his bed two days after, and died within
       the week.
